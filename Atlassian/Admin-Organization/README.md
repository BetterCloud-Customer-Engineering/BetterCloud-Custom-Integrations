* User Management API: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/user-management/rest/intro/

## Notes
* You must generate an Admin API key. This is different from an Account API key.  
  *  Sign into Atlassian Admin console as an **Organization Admin**
  *  Go to Settings > API keys
  *  Click “Create API Key”
* Users must be **"managed users"**, which means your domain must be managed/registered with Atlassian. You cannot take action on any users who are not managed users.
